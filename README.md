# 1. Introduction

Secret Dungeon in CMU is a rogue-like game which is dedicated to helping CMU students get familiar with the inner connection structure of different buildings. In this game, you will be facing different monsters, such as assignments, quizzes, midterms and finals. The only way to survive is to beat all the specified monsters and find the way out. The map below shows the part where Hamerschlag Hall, Wean Hall and Scott Hall connect with each other.

Use mouse to aim at your target, and right-click to fire the weapon Dart. Dart can be reflected after hitting the monster. If you are brave enough to catch this Dart, you can upgrade this Dart to Magic Green Dart, which will cause extra magic damage to the monster.

●  Items 

Along the way to beat those bosses, there are many Assignments wandering inside the building. You can beat them easily. After they are finished, they will drop different kinds of items. To collect these items, you can become stronger and more confident to face the bosses.
